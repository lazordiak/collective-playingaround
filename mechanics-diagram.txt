== Connecting to the server ==
PlayerClient -> Server: 1. connect
Server -> Server: 2. Add client to socket list
Server -> PlayerClient: 3. setPrompt { prompt: String }
Server -> PlayerClient: 4. [To All] addPlayer { id: String }
PlayerClient -> PlayerClient: 5. Add player with id
Server -> PlayerClient: 6. startDrawing { }
note right: Only if client is the first player

== Disconnecting from the server ==

PlayerClient -> Server: 1. Disconnect
Server -> Server: 2. Remove client from socket list
Server -> PlayerClient: 3. [To All] removePlayer { id: String }
PlayerClient -> PlayerClient: 4. Remove player with id

== Drawing Mechanics ==

Server -> PlayerClient: 1. startDrawing { }

loop Until ink is used up
    PlayerClient -> Server: 2. drawPoint { x: Integer, y: Integer, colorRed: Integer, \ncolorGreen: Integer, colorBlue: Integer, colorAlpha: Integer }
    note right: For simplicity's sake, let's force everyone to have the same size canvas
    Server -> PlayerClient: 3. [To All] drawPoint { x: Integer, y: Integer, colorRed: Integer, \ncolorGreen: Integer, colorBlue: Integer, colorAlpha: Integer }
end

PlayerClient -> Server: 4. nextPlayer { }
Server -> Server: 5. find id of next player on queue
Server -> PlayerClient: [Only to the next player] 6. startDrawing { }
