    Server -> PlayerClient: 6. currentPlayer { id: String }
end

LOOP Until ink is used up
    PlayerClient -> Server: 2. drawPoint { x: Integer, y: Integer, colorRed: Integer, \ncolorGreen: Integer, colorBlue: Integer, colorAlpha: Integer }
    note right: x and y is normalized
    Server -> PlayerClient: 3. [To All] drawPoint { x: Integer, y: Integer, colorRed: Integer, \ncolorGreen: Integer, colorBlue: Integer, colorAlpha: Integer }
    PlayerClient -> PlayerClient: 4. Draw on canvas
end

PlayerClient -> Server: 5. nextPlayer { }
Server -> Server: 6. find id of next player on queue
Server -> PlayerClient: 7. [To All] currentPlayer { id: String }
